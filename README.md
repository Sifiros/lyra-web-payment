Demonstrator Webauthn + Payment request + Payment handler

Currently online [here](https://test-payment-handler.appspot.com/)

To test it, you have to install the payment handler at the bottom of the page.

After that, clic the button Lauch payment Request next to the phone.

If the installed payment handler does not appear, uninstall and reinstall it.

If it appears, select it and click the paiment button, i will probably fail the first time, just reclick on launch payment request and retry.

A login page will appear. It does not works at this time.

If you wants to try the webauthn authentication, you can do it [here](https://test-payment-handler.appspot.com/pages/authentication.html)
